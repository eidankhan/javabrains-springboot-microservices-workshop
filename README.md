# üìò Spring Boot Microservices Level 1 - Agenda Overview

**Video**: [Spring Boot Microservices Level 1 - Agenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8IQb4ofjDo&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTZSKAFG6aCDVDP86Qx4lNas)  
**Channel**: Java Brains  
**Focus**: Microservices architecture with Spring Boot ‚Äî structure, communication, and discovery.

---

## üîπ What This Course Covers

- **Building a Microservices App from Scratch**
  - Start with simple Java Spring Boot services.
  - Gradually layer in real-world communication techniques.
  - Emphasis on practical workflow and clean architecture.

- **Key Concepts Introduced**
  - Service separation and independent deployability.
  - API communication between services using `RestTemplate` and `WebClient`.
  - Dynamic service discovery via **Eureka Server**.
  - Load balancing and fault tolerance (later levels introduce Hystrix and resilience tools).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used

- **Spring Boot**: Core framework for microservices.
- **RestTemplate / WebClient**: To manage API calls between services.
- **Eureka**: Service registry for dynamic discovery.
- **Spring Cloud**: (Introduced later) for enhancements like configuration and load balancing.

---

## üß± Architecture Blueprint

The project builds:
- **Three core services**: Catalog, Info, Ratings.
- Each handles a distinct domain responsibility.
- Services communicate to aggregate data for the client-facing API.

---

## üß© Skills You‚Äôll Practice

- Breaking a monolithic app into smaller services.
- Designing APIs for inter-service communication.
- Centralized service registration and discovery.
- Applying best practices for microservice structuring.

---

## üîç Best Practices Mentioned (Later Explored)

- Avoid hardcoding service URLs ‚Äî use Eureka instead.
- Prevent tight coupling between services with clean APIs.
- Prefer `WebClient` over `RestTemplate` for non-blocking calls.

## üìù Mini Summary

This course walks you through building a real-world microservices system step by step. The agenda frames core concepts you'll explore: service communication, smart discovery via Eureka, and scaling services independently. It's highly practical ‚Äî ideal for devs transitioning from monoliths or diving into Spring Boot microservices for the first time.
